Description: molecular mechanisms have been elucidated for only a few fusions, in part because of the labor-intensive nature of the required functional assays. Therefore, we developed a domain-based network approach to infer the pathways that are functionally associated with a fusion and identify potential therapeutic targets in these pathways
Keyword: Fusion pathway prediction, network analysis, protein domain interaction, next-generation sequencing, cancer therapeutic targets
